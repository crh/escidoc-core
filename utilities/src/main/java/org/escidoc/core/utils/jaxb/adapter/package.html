This package exists, to avoid JAXB to create a new adapter in a package named "org.w3._2001.xmlschema". The problem
is, if you have multiple JAXB bindings, each binding will generate this package with adapter classes named "Adapter[n]"
(where n is a number starting with 1), and these adapter classes will overwrite each other and this can cause conflicts
on runtime, if for example Adapter1 of one JAXB binding overwrites Adapter1 of another JAXB binding.<br/>
<br/>
Current conflict: dataobjects-spec module and fedora-service-rest module.
